2. **Start the server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. **Open in browser:**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

## Features

- âœ… Generate native mobile apps from any website
- âœ… Upload custom logos and splash screens
- âœ… Download ready-to-build Ionic projects
- âœ… Support for both Android and iOS
- âœ… Beautiful web interface

## How to Build Generated Apps

After downloading a generated app, you have two options:

### Option 1: Automatic Setup (Recommended)

The server attempts to automatically build and sync your app during generation. If this succeeds, your app is ready to use immediately.

### Option 2: Manual Setup

If automatic setup fails or you need to set up the app manually:

#### Using the Setup Scripts:

**Windows:**
```bash
# Navigate to your app directory
cd your-generated-app
# Run the setup script from the EZ-GEN root directory
..\setup-app.bat
```

**Mac/Linux:**
```bash
# Navigate to your app directory
cd your-generated-app
# Run the setup script from the EZ-GEN root directory
node ../setup-app.js
```

#### Manual Commands:

```bash
cd your-generated-app
npm install          # Install dependencies
npm run build        # Build the web assets
npx cap sync         # Sync Capacitor platforms
```

### Opening in IDEs:

Once setup is complete:

```bash
npx cap open android  # Open in Android Studio
npx cap open ios      # Open in Xcode (macOS only)
```

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### Gradle Error: "capacitor.settings.gradle not found"

This error has been **automatically fixed** in EZ-GEN! New apps generated by the server will:

1. âœ… Auto-install dependencies during generation
2. âœ… Auto-build web assets 
3. âœ… Auto-sync Capacitor platforms
4. âœ… Be ready to use immediately

If you still encounter issues, use the provided setup scripts:

**Windows:** `setup-app.bat`  
**Mac/Linux:** `node setup-app.js <app-directory>`

See `GRADLE_FIX_NOTES.md` for detailed information about this fix.
