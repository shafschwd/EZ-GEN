## 🔧 Technical Changes

### Server.js Updates
```javascript
// New asset handling
if (logo) {
  await fs.copy(logo.path, path.join(appDir, 'resources/icon.png'));
  await fs.remove(logo.path); // Clean up upload
}

// Enhanced Capacitor config
capacitorConfig = capacitorConfig.replace(
  /webDir: '[^']*'/,
  `webDir: 'www',
  plugins: {
    CapacitorAssets: {
      iconPath: 'resources/icon.png',
      splashPath: 'resources/splash.png',
    }
  }`
);
```

### Template Updates
- Added `@capacitor/assets` to devDependencies
- Enhanced `capacitor.config.ts` with assets configuration
- Added `resources/` directory structure

### Setup Scripts Enhanced
Both `setup-app.js` and `setup-app.bat` now include:
