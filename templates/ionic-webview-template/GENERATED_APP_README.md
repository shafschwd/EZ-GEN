# 📱 Your EZ-GEN Mobile App

Congratulations! Your mobile app has been generated successfully.

## 🚀 Quick Start

Your app should be ready to use immediately. If you encounter any build issues, follow these steps:

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Build the App
```bash
npm run build
```

### 3. Generate App Icons and Splash Screens
```bash
npx capacitor-assets generate
```

### 4. Sync Capacitor Platforms
```bash
npx cap sync
```

## 📱 Opening in IDEs

### Android Studio
```bash
npx cap open android
```

### Xcode (macOS only)
```bash
npx cap open ios
```

## 🔧 Development Commands

- **Start dev server**: `npm start`
- **Build for production**: `npm run build`
- **Generate assets**: `npx capacitor-assets generate`
- **Sync platforms**: `npx cap sync`
- **Add platform**: `npx cap add android` or `npx cap add ios`

## 🎨 Custom Assets

Your app includes custom logo and splash screen assets in the `resources/` directory:
- `resources/icon.png` - App icon (should be 1024x1024px)
- `resources/splash.png` - Splash screen (should be 2732x2732px)

These are automatically processed by @capacitor/assets to generate all required sizes for iOS and Android.

## ❗ Common Issues

### "capacitor.settings.gradle not found"
This means Capacitor hasn't been synced properly. Run:
```bash
npx cap sync
```

### Build Fails
Make sure you have:
- Node.js 16+ installed
- All dependencies installed (`npm install`)
- Built the web assets (`npm run build`)

### Android Studio Won't Open
Ensure you have:
- Android Studio installed
- Android SDK configured
- Java 11+ installed
